üåßÔ∏è Rain Prediction in Australia ‚Äì A Machine Learning Approach üå¶Ô∏è
Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow in different locations across Australia using machine learning models. By analyzing meteorological data, we can gain insights into weather patterns and improve predictive accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains weather observations from various locations in Australia. It includes attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, with the target variable being "RainTomorrow" (Yes/No).

Key Steps in the Project
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
Encoded categorical variables.
Scaled numerical features for optimal model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized key weather patterns using Seaborn and Plotly.
Analyzed correlations between features.
Identified class imbalances in the dataset.
Feature Engineering:

Applied feature selection techniques like SelectKBest.
Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA.
Resampled data to handle imbalances.
Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
Model Evaluation:

Used accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC for performance evaluation.
Compared different models to determine the best-performing one.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn, XGBoost (Machine Learning)
Pickle (Model Serialization)
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to predict weather conditions based on historical data. The insights gained from this analysis can be useful for weather forecasting and decision-making in agriculture and disaster management.
